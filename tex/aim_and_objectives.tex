  \begin{block}{Aim}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{
        To develop (more precisely: adapt) CFD code capable of simulating the breakup of liquid jets and sheets, particularly in cases involving impact with a solid surface.
      }

  \begin{block}{Objectives}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{ choose appropriate CFD method }
      \item{ develop simulation software based on CFD method }
      \item{ validate against data from physical experiments }
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Data of interest:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{ velocity distribution of spray droplets }
      \item{ distribution of liquid water content (LWC) in spray cloud }
      \item{ size distribution of spray droplets }

\begin{frame}{\thesec}{}
  \vspace*{-2\baselineskip}
  \begin{block}{Benefits of simulating the spray generation process:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{
        no calibration of empirical parameters required
      }
      \item{
        applicability under general circumstances (superstructure geometries, weather conditions, etc.)
      }
	  \item{
	    ability to predict spray cloud behavior on existing vessels and superstructures based on weather conditions, allowing for the development of vessel- or superstructure-specific icing forecasts
	  }
	  \item{
	    ability to predict spray cloud behavior for vessels and superstructures of arbitrary geometry while still in the design phase, allowing for the inclusion of anti-icing measures in potential problem areas
	  }
    \end{itemize}
