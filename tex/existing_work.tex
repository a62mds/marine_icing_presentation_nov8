    \begin{itemize}
      \item{ large variation in length scales:
	      \begin{itemize}
	        \item{
			  wave-superstructure interactions: $\sim \text{1}$ to $\text{10}$ m
		    }
		    \item{
			  spray droplets can have diameters as small as $\sim \text{10}^{-\text{5}}$ m
			}
		  \end{itemize}

	    \begin{itemize}
	      \item{ wave-superstructure interactions: $\sim \text{1}$ s }
		  \item{ droplet formation processes occur much faster }

	  ...a single simulation which hopes to resolve these phenomena would be a monumental undertaking and could not be completed within the first half of this century.
